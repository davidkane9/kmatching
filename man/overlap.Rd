\title{Checks the similarity of a group of vectors}
\usage{
overlap(mat, compare = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{mat}{The matrix of vectors to compare}

\item{compare}{Whether to compare to vectors distributed uniformly on a simplex scaled
by the sum of the rightmost vector}
}
\description{
This function takes a matrix as an argument
where the columns are vectors we want to compare
and calculates the correlation and Euclidean
distance between these vectors
}
\examples{
data <- data.frame(size = rnorm(50), weight = rep(.02, 50))
weights <- kmatch(x = data, match.var = "size", weight.var = "weight", n = 100, replace = TRUE)[[1]]
overlap(weights)
